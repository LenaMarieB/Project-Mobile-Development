# Project-Mobile-Development

Members : OMNES Camille and BERNADINE LÃ©na

This is the GitHub repository for our Mobile Development project. We decided to use SwiftUI for this project.

The goal was to create an application for an event, displaying a home page with the main schedule of the first day and a detail page for each activity.

We did pair programming during the first class.

It is split into two branches, one for the design and one for the API.

We didn't have time to finish everything :

- The changing date of the day on the home page.
- The location image hides the location name, we didn't have the time to solve this issue.
- And the names of the speakers may not always be accurate.
- We also didn't have time to test the functions or make the design better.
