# Project-Mobile-Development

Members : OMNES Camille and BERNADINE LÃ©na

This is the GitHub repository for our Mobile Development project. We decided to use SwiftUI for this project.

The goal was to create an application for an event, displaying a home page with the main schedule of the first day and a detail page for each activity.

We did pair programming during the first class.

It is split into two branches, one for the design and one for the API.
